# PangyaFileCore
  
Created for reading pangya .IFF files with GameServer

My current idea is to help the community in reading the files.

Updates 06/09/2019, Supporting Multiple Files Now.

Created the PangyaFileCore Library. With this, the entire structure and responsibility of reading the files belongs to this library.


I thank the User eantoniobr who has helped.

You can also help, my thanks will be added here.

                                               How to use:

it is necessary to create a folder named "data", inside it you must place the file "pangya_gb.iff"

it is also necessary to have Visual Studio 2017 installed on your machine to compile the project

is usable in GameServer or other programs
